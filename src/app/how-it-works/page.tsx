        that went viral in 2005. I thought of doing a similar project but
        exclusively for vegan food brands and restaurants, as well as
        non-alcohlic beverage brands and bars etc.

        The board will consist of one million pixels, but each image slot will
        be 20x20 pixels. The slots are free but they need to adhere to the
        project goal to be approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a big demand for spots with larger resolution than 20x20
        pixels maybe I will introduce a small paid option for that, but the
        demand is unlikely, so we will see.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will have black squares to mark reserved spots, while approving the
        images. This process is not efficient as I am doing it manually, so
        please be patient.

        The million dollar home page went viral and was successfull because it
        was the first of its kind and a novel idea. Since then a lot of
        imitations sprung up and were not successfull, for obvious reasons. So I
        am not trying to make this successfull and I doubt it will be anything
        remotly like that.

      <p>
        I just thought it would be cool to see a board filled with images
        associated with plant based foods and non-alcoholic beverages.

        I also built this site to practice my development skills and to learn. I
        wanted to finally build something small and launch it, and deal with how
        people react with it.

        I want to create interesting and fun experiences on the internet.
        Although this project is pretty basic I am hoping to use this as a first
        learning experience on how to launch something and seeing people react
        to it.
